## ALX Listing App
A project to build a simple Airbnb-style listing page where users can view property listings with images, details, and pricing. The goal is to practice Next.js with Tailwind, TypeScript, and modern UI design while replicating real-world booking platform functionality.


# Project description
The project is organized for clarity and scalability:

components/ â†’ Reusable UI elements (e.g., Navbar, ListingCard).

interfaces/ â†’ TypeScript interfaces for data models and props.

constants/ â†’ Static values like routes, categories, or config options.

public/assets/ â†’ Images, icons, and static files served directly.


# Process
Clone the repository

git clone <repo-url>
cd alx-listing-app


Install dependencies

npm install


Start the development server

npm run dev


Open in browser
Visit ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:3000























This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
